With so much in software and technology dependent on the open sharing of information and past effort, I would be remiss not to do so myself.  Much of my work is owned by the companies for which I've worked, but some of it---and much of my personal effort---is open source.

In particular, I'm proud of:

* [**order-fetcher**](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/order-fetcher): An easy-to-use command-line for extracting order/item data from a WooCommerce site.  As the technical point-of-contact for both the Seattle Kennel Club and Evergreen Basenji Club, I use order-fetcher to generate detailed order information for other club members.

* [**specialty-slurper**](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/specialty-slurper): Fills a niche need for the annual [Basenji Club of America](https://basenji.org) Yearbook, which includes the winners of all Basenji [specialties](https://www.akc.org/sports/conformation/resources/conformation-explanation/) for the year.  There's more hard-coded logic in this tool than I'd prefer, but it saves _hours_ of time for the Yearbook editor every year.

* [**xyzzybot**](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/xyzzybot) (with [fizmo-json](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/fizmo-json)): Still a work-in-progress, xyzzybot brings the glory of Infocom-style text adventures (Zork, anyone?) to Slack.  I particularly like the way that xyzzybot attempts to automatically distinguish game commands (`give flower to troll`) from out-of-band chatter in the channel (`hey, why don't we try giving the flower to the troll?`), with the goal of completely disappearing as the broker between the game and the players.

* [**Automatic mapping layout**](https://observablehq.com/d/58f420d9218ed67d): An Observable HQ notebook that explores using D3's "force layout" tools to create text-adventure-style game maps from minimal easy-to-write input.

* [**Commentator**](http://jaredreisinger.github.io/Commentator/): Although way out-of-date (it's for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013!), Commentator shows the type of user interaction I'm really proud of: when it's doing its job, things _just work_ and you hardly even notice it's there.

I've also contributed odds-and-ends to several open-source projects:

* [ipedrazas/drone-helm](https://github.com/ipedrazas/drone-helm/pull/87)
* [helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/9390)
* Discourse: [pagination](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/4866), [developing via Docker](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/4450), [email whitelisting/blacklisting with GitHub auth](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/4457), and [benchmarking when running in Docker](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/4454)

And, of course, you can always look at [all of my public repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/JaredReisinger?tab=repositories).
