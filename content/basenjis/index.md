I’m the proud “father” of four Basenjis… or of thirteen if you also include the puppies I helped to raise and that now live across the United States. For more about that aspect of things, see [Ture Hounds](https://turehounds.com).

As a bit of crossover between dogs and technology, you can also take a look at:

- [**puppycam.turehounds.com**](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/puppycam.turehounds.com): A site that periodically hosts a 24/7 live-stream (only live for a couple of months every two or three years!) of the puppies we’re raising with news and other details about the puppies as they grow. The site is designed to auto-deploy and auto-refresh any time changes are made to the source.

- [**Ture Hounds "titles" page**](https://turehounds.com/titles/#DC%20Taji%E2%80%99s%20hAfrican%20Queen%20Disa%20SC%20CA%20BCAT%20CGCA%20CGCU%20TKA%20FDX%20RATM): Just because I could, a data-driven presentation and decoder for dog "titles"---the alphabet soup you might see around a dog's name.  (The link pre-fills the decoder with an example based on one of our dogs.)  Everything on that page after the introductory paragraphs is driven by a YAML data file that contains structured information about the titles themselves.
