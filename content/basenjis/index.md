I’m the proud “father” of three Basenjis… or of seven if you include the puppies I helped to raise and that now live across the United States. For more about that aspect of things, see [Ture Hounds](https://turehounds.com).

As a bit of crossover between dogs and technology, you can also take a look at:

- [**puppycam.turehounds.com**](https://github.com/JaredReisinger/puppycam.turehounds.com): A site that hosts a 24/7 live-stream of the puppies we’ve whelped (only live for a couple of months every two or three years!) with news and other details about the puppies as they grow. The site is designed to auto-deploy and auto-refresh any time changes are made to the source.
