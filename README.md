Content and layout for vNext [jaredreisinger.com](http://jaredreisinger.com) website.

Layout and SCSS/JS originally from [Forty](https://themes.gohugo.io/forty/) (and [github](https://github.com/MarcusVirg/forty)), but substantially revamped to minimize and streamline, and customize.

The templates for Forty were strangely duplicative; I've endeavored to streamline this so that (for instance) both list and single pages can take advantage of the home page banner styles, tiles, etc.  Now, any page can opt in to any/all of the following:

* tiles
* "two" (what a name!)
* regular list items in "tiles" style?
* contact form
